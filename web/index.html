		<h1>Welcome to the PidFile project page</h1>
		<p>PidFile allows you to make sure that there is only one instance of a program running
		at any point in time. This is achieved with a pid file that records the pid of a program.
		When it starts any existing pid file is checked to see if the program that created it is
		still running. If so the calling program can halt or take remedial action.</p>
		<h2>One way to use it</h2>
<pre>
require 'pidfile'

unless Pid::PidFile.set_pid("/var/run/app.pid")
  puts "This process is already running!"
  exit
end

# ...the rest of your program goes here
</pre>
		<h2>Or in a more Ruby like way</h2>
<pre>
require 'pidfile'

Pid::PidFile.new("/var/run/app.pid") do
  # ...the rest of your program goes here
end
</pre>
		<p>If an instance is already running then it will throw a <tt>Pid::AlreadyRunning</tt> exception</p>
